Jayan Jose Thomas calls for changes in established thinking to harness its potential. India, like many South Asian countries, has a young population. Increasing enrolment in education and a growing exodus of young people from agriculture are swelling the jobless ranks.

Of India’s total workforce of 471.0 million, only 12.3% are regular workers who receive some form of social security and are covered, at least partially, by laws that protect labour rights. The rest are mostly casual workers or petty producers surviving under various degrees of informality.

India’s working classes deserve real improvements in living and working conditions. This can happen only with a massive expansion in government spending. Proposals might include the setting up of industries linked to food processing or affordable housing in rural areas.
